# Development-of-a-Tour-Guide-for-the-Lambda-Zoo
Bachelor Project, 2023 At DTU, where we develop a tour guide for the lambda zoo, consisting of a REACT website, which can use various reduction strategies on given lambda expressions.

## How to run locally

## Requirements
- You need to have Node.js installed



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` (but only once)
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
This will automatically open a browser with the app running. If that doesn't happen, you can manually open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
